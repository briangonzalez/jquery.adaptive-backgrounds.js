<p>Quick turnover, anyone? A <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/pull/1525'>recent incompatibility with Liquid v2.5.2</a> produced a nasty bug in which <code>include</code> tags were not rendered properly within <code>if</code> blocks.</p>

<p>This release also includes a better handling of detached servers (prints pid and the command for killing the process). <strong>Note</strong>: the <code>--detach</code> flag and <code>--watch</code> flags are presently incompatible in 1.2.x. Fix for that coming soon!</p>

<p>For a full list of the fixes in this release, check out <a href='/docs/history/'>the change log</a>!</p>
