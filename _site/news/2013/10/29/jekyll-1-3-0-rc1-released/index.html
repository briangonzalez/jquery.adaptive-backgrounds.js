<p>Jekyll 1.3.0 is going to be a big release! In order to make sure we didn&#8217;t screw anything up too badly, we&#8217;re making a release candidate available for any early adopters who want to give the latest and greatest code a spin without having to clone a repository from git.</p>

<p>Please take this prerelease for a spin and <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/new'>let us know</a> if you run into any issues!</p>
