<p>Coming just 10 days after the release of v1.1.0, v1.1.1 is out with a patch for the nasty excerpt inception bug (<a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/1339'>#1339</a>) and non-zero exit codes for invalid commands (<a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/1338'>#1338</a>).</p>

<p>To all those affected by the <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/1321'>strange excerpt bug in v1.1.0</a>, I&#8217;m sorry. I think we have it all patched up and it should be deployed to <a href='http://pages.github.com'>GitHub Pages</a> in the next couple weeks. Thank you for your patience!</p>
