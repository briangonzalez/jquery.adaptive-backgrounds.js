<p>Hey! After many months of hard work by Jekyll&#8217;s contributors, we&#8217;re excited to announce the first major release of the project in a long while. v1.0.0 is finally here! While the list of improvements and bug fixes is <a href='/docs/history/#100__20130506'>quite lengthy</a>, here are the highlights (thanks to <a href='http://twitter.com/BenBalter'>@benbalter</a> for the examples and for compiling this list):</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for the Gist tag for easily embedding Gists (<a href='https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555251'>example</a>)</li>

<li>Automatically generated post excerpts (<a href='https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555369'>example</a>)</li>

<li>Save and preview drafts before publishing (<a href='https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555992'>example</a>)</li>
</ul>
